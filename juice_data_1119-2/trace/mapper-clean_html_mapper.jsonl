{"original text":"Why have we not seen a fracturing of the Democratic Party similar to the ongoing conflict within the Republican Party ? Why is there no tea party of the left ? Explain like I'm five. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are two major political parties in the United States. These parties have different ideologies and policies, and their members often disagree with each other on various issues.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party has recently been experiencing a lot of internal conflict, with different factions within the party disagreeing on various issues. This has led to the formation of the tea party, which is a group of conservatives within the Republican Party who believe in limited government and lower taxes.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Party has also had its fair share of internal conflicts and differing viewpoints, but it has not seen the same level of division as the Republican Party. One reason for this may be that the Democratic Party is generally more diverse and includes a wider range of viewpoints, so it is easier for different factions within the party to find common ground and work together. Additionally, the Democratic Party has traditionally been more successful at unifying its members around a common set of goals and values.\r\n\r\nOverall, the political landscape in the United States is complex and constantly changing, and there are many factors that can influence the level of conflict within a political party.","processed_text":"Why have we not seen a fracturing of the Democratic Party similar to the ongoing conflict within the Republican Party ?

{"original text":"EIL5 : Why should we not classify obesity as a disease or why should obesity be classified as a disease Explain like I'm five. Obesity is a medical condition in which a person has an excessive amount of body fat. It is often measured by calculating a person's body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of a person's weight in relation to their height.\r\n\r\nThere is ongoing debate about whether obesity should be classified as a disease. Some people believe that obesity should be classified as a disease because it can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. These conditions can be life-threatening and can significantly decrease a person's quality of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people argue that obesity should not be classified as a disease because it is often caused by unhealthy behaviors, such as poor diet and lack of exercise. These behaviors can be changed through lifestyle changes, such as eating healthier and exercising more, which can help a person lose weight and improve their overall health.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, whether or not obesity should be classified as a disease is a complex issue and depends on how you look at it. Some people believe that it should be classified as a disease because it can lead to serious health problems, while others believe that it should not be classified as a disease because it is often caused by unhealthy behaviors that can be changed.","processed_text":"EIL5 : Why should we not classify obesity as a disease or why should obesity be classified as a disease Explain like I'm five.
