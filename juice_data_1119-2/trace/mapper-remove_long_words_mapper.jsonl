{"original text":"Why there is more inequality in the US when we have such a progressive tax system URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.  Progressive taxation is a system in which people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than people who earn less money. In the United States, the progressive tax system is designed to reduce income inequality by taking a larger percentage of income from people who are more able to pay, and using that money to fund programs and services that benefit the entire population, such as education, healthcare, and social security. \nHowever, there are still many factors that can contribute to inequality in the United States, even with a progressive tax system in place. For example, some people may have access to better education and job opportunities, which can lead to higher incomes. Additionally, there may be systemic biases and discrimination that make it more difficult for certain groups of people to advance in their careers or earn as much as others. \nFinally, the overall distribution of wealth in a society, rather than just income, also plays a role in inequality. Wealth, or the total value of a person's assets (such as their savings, investments, and property), can be passed down from generation to generation, which can create a more unequal distribution of resources over time. \nOverall, while a progressive tax system can help to reduce inequality, it is just one factor among many that contribute to the overall level of inequality in a society.","processed_text":"Why there is more inequality in the US when we have such a progressive tax system URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.

{"original text":"How are capital cities chosen for a state \/ province \/ country ? I was just curious as to how capital cities are generally chosen .

There are several factors that can influence the decision of where to locate a capital city. \nOne factor is the size and population of the area. A capital city should be large enough to accommodate the needs of the government, including housing for government officials and space for government buildings and offices. \nAnother factor is the location of the capital city. It is often chosen to be in a central location within the state, province, or country, so that it is easily accessible to all parts of the region. \nSometimes, the capital city is chosen because it is already an important economic or cultural center. For example, London is the capital of the United Kingdom because it is a major financial and cultural center. \nIn some cases, the capital city may be changed by the government.
