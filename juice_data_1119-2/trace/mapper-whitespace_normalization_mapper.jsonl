{"original text":"Please explain what is \"Computation time\" In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.

The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier-Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier-Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier-Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things.

{"original text":"Please explain what is \"Fast Fourier transform\" A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors. As a result, it manages to reduce the complexity of computing the DFT from\nO\n(\nN\n2\n)\n{\\textstyle O\\left(N^{2}\\right)}\n, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to\nO\n(\nN\nlog\n⁡\nN\n)\n{\\textstyle O(N\\log N)}\n, where\nN\n{\\displaystyle N}\nis the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where N may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of round-off error, many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple complex-number arithmetic to group theory and number theory.\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for applications in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805. In 1994, Gilbert Strang described the FFT as \"the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime\", and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the IEEE magazine Computing in Science & Engineering.\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the factorization of N, but there are FFTs with O(N log N) complexity for all N, even for prime N.

The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where N may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of round-off error, many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple complex-number arithmetic to group theory and number theory.\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for applications in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805. In 1994, Gilbert Strang described the FFT as \"the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime\", and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the IEEE magazine Computing in Science & Engineering.\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the factorization of N, but there are FFTs with O(N log N) complexity for all N, even for prime N. Many FFT algorithms depend only on the fact that\ne\n−\n2\nπ\ni\n\/\nN\n{\\textstyle e^{-2\\pi i\/N}}\nis an N-th primitive root of unity, and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any finite field, such as number-theoretic transforms. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1\/N factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it."}
