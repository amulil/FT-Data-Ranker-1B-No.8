{"original text":"What exactly is a “derivative”? In mathematics, a derivative is a mathematical operation that gives the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables. It is a fundamental concept in calculus, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change and the accumulation of quantities.The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is typically denoted by f'(x) or df\/dx. It measures how much the function f(x) changes as the variable x changes. For example, if f(x) represents the position of a moving object at time x, then the derivative f'(x) represents the velocity of the object at time x.Derivatives have many important applications in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. They are used to model and analyze the behavior of systems that change over time, such as the movement of a car, the growth of a population, or the fluctuation of stock prices.There are several different types of derivatives, including first derivatives, second derivatives, and higher-order derivatives. Each type of derivative represents a different aspect of the function's behavior, and they can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.","processed_text":"What exactly is a \"derivative\"?

Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.\nCAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms.

A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.\nComputer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.\nAlthough CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.","processed_text":"Please explain what is \"Automated medical diagnosis\" Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images.

Parametric simulation methods can be used to improve the performance of a system. In this method, the input of each variable is varied with other parameters remaining constant and the effect on the design objective is observed.

Such methods are known as ‘numerical optimization’ or ‘simulation-based optimization’.\nIn simulation experiment, the goal is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system. However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, the goal is to find optimal values for the input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization.\nSpecific simulation–based optimization methods can be chosen according to Figure 1 based on the decision variable types.\nOptimization exists in two main branches of operations research:\nOptimization parametric (static) – The objective is to find the values of the parameters, which are “static” for all states, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing a function. In this case, one can use mathematical programming, such as linear programming. In this scenario, simulation helps when the parameters contain noise or the evaluation of the problem would demand excessive computer time, due to its complexity.\nOptimization control (dynamic) – This is used largely in computer science and electrical engineering. The optimal control is per state and the results change in each of them. One can use mathematical programming, as well as dynamic programming.
