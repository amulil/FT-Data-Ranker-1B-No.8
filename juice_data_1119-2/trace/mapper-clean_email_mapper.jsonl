Before presenting your idea or project, take some time to write down its strengths and weaknesses, its benefits and its disadvantages. The preparation makes up more than 50% of a project or idea's success.\n2. Make sure you always have a written document at your disposal, a drawing, an illustration, a precise description of your idea. This will contribute to your assurance. What’s more, you will have some excellent documentation at your disposal to present to your audience, in case your explanation is insufficient.\n3. Address all four brains of your dialogue partner: the analytic brain requires facts, figures, concepts. The organisational brain requires plans, phases, measures of progress; the communicative brain is looking for humanity, a convivial approach and warm responsibility. Finally, don’t forget the creative brain, which feeds on enthusiasm, novelties, surprises, aesthetics and a perspective.\n4. Opportunity knocks for those who are up for some adventure. Dare to try original and surprising presentation strategies. A new idea also merits new \"packaging\".\n5. Never ignore the 3S Factor: Security, Security, Security. To your audience, your idea represents a number of risks, whether real or virtual. Reassure them with intelligence and precision.\n6. Calmly accept objections: the sale starts when your dialogue partner says « No ». This is the ideal moment to really test the interest of your idea. Take this first « no! » as a compliment ...\n7. Always have something up your sleeve. Do not always throw all your assets into the game during your presentation.\n8. Don’t forget that the more original, new, « out-of-the-box » your idea is, the more resistance you will meet with. To create is to deal with reality.\n9. Preparation + rationality + enthusiasm + creativity do not automatically equal success. A precise and determined follow-up is one of the ingredients of success that is often forgotten.\n10. A new idea has to make its way into your dialogue partner’s brain. Even if it has become evident to you, this idea is an unusual proposition for your dialogue partner. Choose the right moment to present your idea: often the momentum is just as important as the quality of an idea.\n36\n© Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n10 SUGGESTIONS TO BOOST UP YOUR CREATIVITY 1.
